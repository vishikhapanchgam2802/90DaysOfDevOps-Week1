# üß† Task 2: Protocols & Ports for DevOps
## Week 1 - Networking Challenge (90 Days of DevOps 2025)

---

### üåç Overview
In DevOps workflows, network protocols and ports are crucial for communication between applications, servers, and services.  
Knowing which protocols use which ports helps in configuring firewalls, security groups, and troubleshooting connectivity issues.

## üîå Common Protocols & Ports

| Protocol | Port | Description & Relevance in DevOps |
|----------|------|----------------------------------|
| **HTTP** | 80   | Standard web traffic; used for websites and APIs |
| **HTTPS** | 443 | Secure web traffic with encryption (SSL/TLS) |
| **SSH**  | 22   | Secure remote access to servers; CI/CD automation |
| **FTP**  | 21   | File transfer between client and server |
| **SFTP** | 22   | Secure file transfer over SSH |
| **DNS**  | 53   | Resolving domain names to IP addresses |
| **SMTP** | 25   | Sending emails, notifications, alerts |
| **POP3** | 110  | Email retrieval from servers |
| **IMAP** | 143  | Email retrieval with sync |
| **TELNET** | 23 | Remote terminal access (insecure, mostly replaced by SSH) |
| **MySQL** | 3306 | Database access for MySQL |
| **PostgreSQL** | 5432 | Database access for PostgreSQL |
| **Redis** | 6379 | In-memory data store for caching |
| **Docker API** | 2375 / 2376 | Remote management of Docker containers (2376 is TLS secured) |
| **Kubernetes API** | 6443 | Secure cluster management |

## üîÅ Relevance to DevOps

| Use Case | Protocols / Ports |
|----------|------------------|
| **CI/CD Pipelines** | SSH, Docker API, Kubernetes API |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, SNMP |
| **Security & Compliance** | HTTPS, SFTP, SSH |
| **Database Management** | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis |
